## My Project
This is a little project that I made because people were talking about automating their arrival on BeCode site.  
Nobody did it, so I did.  
I won't really use it, it was just for the fun of learning something new.  
To make this I took my Sunday and learned AutoHotKey and what are the different possibilities of it.   
I just scratched the surface but it was very interesting, fun and I can impressively facilitate my everyday's life with what I learned.  
To use it, read the instructions below.  

## Instructions:  
1. Download Autohotkey on this site: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Create a file with an 'ahk' extension.  
3. Copy my text file in the repository and paste it in it.
4. You will maybe need to change the coordinates because of the screen size difference, you can try by seeing where the mouse is moving and rearranging by comparing to where your button is. (first is X and second is Y, it is measured in pixels). You may also need to change in the code the browser, I put chrome into the code.
5. Save your file and double click on it to run it.
6. Press 'ctrl + t' to activate the timer, if you dont want it activated anymore, exit autohotkey in the running programs.
- You can also launch it (ctrl + t) just before you go away when you can't point and it will do it from self.
